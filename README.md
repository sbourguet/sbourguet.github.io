# About me

I am a graduate student in Harvard University's Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences working with Marianna Linz. My research interests are centered on climate change, though I like to think about the problem from many different angles. Currently, I am studying stratospheric water vapor variability with a focus on how it may act as a feedback to anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing, but I have also worked on projects regarding ocean heat uptake, extreme temperatures, and the geologic carbon cycle. I also enjoy teaching, and I have taught courses on climate change, fluids, and stratospheric dynamics.
